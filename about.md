# About me

I have a Master in Economics from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) and my thesis was titled _"Modeling Heterogeneous Behavior of Danish Stock Market Analysts"_.

I have spent all of my professional career in the financial sector in various roles and departments, but all of them allowed me to use most of my working hours applying statistics and machine learning to different tasks.

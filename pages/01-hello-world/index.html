I have spent all of my career in the financial sector, applying statistics and machine learning to various problems. In addition, I design my own trading strategies/algorithms on the side, using <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php">Interactive Brokers</a> as my main broker.</p> <p>Naturally, I am a Bayesian in the sense that the methodology speaks to me intuitively with its focus on assigning probabilities to hypotheses while assumed that data is fixed, but I strive to learn about frequentist tools as well, such that I always use the &#40;expected&#41; best tool for the job.<em>&quot;If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot;</em> and all that. And as you will soon see, most of the first blog posts will focus on &quot;the basics&quot; of frequentist statistics. Not just because it is used extensively in later blog posts, but also because it helps to maintain a strong foundation.</p> <p>For these reasons the name of the blog <em>The Bayesian Quant</em>.</p> <h2 id=programming_language ><a href="#programming_language" class=header-anchor >Programming language</a></h2> <p>I predominantly use Python in my professional life, but this blog will mostly use the Julia language when displaying code blocks. Why? Because I find <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> to be the most intuitive language... and <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/">many other reasons</a>. I cannot rule out the odd appearances of Python or R code blocks, though.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Mads Koefoed.

# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog on quantitative trading, statistics, machine learning, and more. I have spent most of my career in the financial sector and design my own trading strategies/algorithms on the side, using [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php) as my main broker.

Naturally, I am a Bayesian in the sense that the methodology speaks to me intuitively with its focus on assigning probabilities to hypotheses while assumed that data is fixed, but I strive to learn about frequentist tools as well, such that I always use the (expected) best tool for the job._"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"_ and all that. And as you will soon see, most of the first blog posts will focus on "the basics" of frequentist statistics. Not just because it is used extensively in later blog posts, but also because it helps to maintain a strong foundation.

For these reasons the name of the blog _The Bayesian Quant_.

## Programming language
I predominantly use Python in my professional life, but this blog will mostly use the Julia language when displaying code blocks. Why? Because I find [Julia](https://julialang.org/) to be the most intuitive language... and [many other reasons](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/). I cannot rule out the odd appearances of Python or R code blocks, though.
